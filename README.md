# 2010---2015-FARS-Crash-Data-Analysis
FARS Crash Data investigation employing visualization and regression

#### Purpose of Notebook:

In 2015 the Obama Whitehouse posed a series of questions related to national traffic safety, and solicited answers to these questions. The FARS data was identified as a source of potential relavent data. This notebook focuses on one question asked by the Obama administration.

### TODO:

- Address multicollinearity of features for regression models, either by removing features or employing a ridge regression model.
- Calculate correlation coefficients for feature correlation with number of fatal crashes per capita. 
- Test correlation coefficients to determine statistical significance. Only include statistically significant correlations in regression model.
